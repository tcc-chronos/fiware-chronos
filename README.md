## About Chronos

Chronos is a FIWARE Generic Enabler that manages the full lifecycle of deep learning forecasting models for IoT sensor data. It integrates natively with **Orion Context Broker**, **IoT Agent**, and **STH-Comet** to:

- Collect historical data and train recurrent neural networks (LSTM/GRU).
- Schedule asynchronous training pipelines with Celery workers.
- Publish forecasts as NGSI attributes and optional subscriptions for downstream analytics.
- Provide observability via Loki, Promtail, and Grafana dashboards.

Chronos fits the **Processing & Analysis** FIWARE chapter and targets solutions that need adaptive forecasting tightly coupled with NGSI context management.

## Architecture

![Chronos Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef896d44-32df-437f-bf9a-262290983d4a)

Chronos follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Domain** – entity definitions (`Model`, `TrainingJob`, `PredictionRecord`) and invariants.
- **Application** – use cases orchestrating FIWARE gateways, repositories, and schedulers.
- **Infrastructure** – adapters for MongoDB/GridFS, Orion, STH-Comet, IoT Agent, Celery.
- **Presentation** – FastAPI controllers exposing management and forecasting APIs.
- **Workers** – Celery beat/worker processes for background orchestration.

Detailed diagrams and entity relationships are available in [`docs/clean_architecture_db.md`](docs/clean_architecture_db.md) and the [User Guide](https://fiware-chronos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/overview/).

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is published on Read the Docs:

- [User Guide](https://fiware-chronos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/overview/)
- [Installation & Administration Guide](https://fiware-chronos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-guide/deployment/)
- [API Reference](https://fiware-chronos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/api/)
- [Developer Topics](https://fiware-chronos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/architecture/)

Documentation sources are stored under `docs/` and built via MkDocs with FIWARE Read the Docs CSS (see [`mkdocs.yml`](mkdocs.yml)).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux host with AVX-capable CPU (for TensorFlow)
- Docker & Docker Compose v2
- Python 3.12
- FIWARE stack (Orion, IoT Agent, STH-Comet) reachable from Chronos

### Local Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tcc-chronos/fiware-chronos.git
cd fiware-chronos
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
make run
```

The `.env` file documents all configuration parameters. Refer to the Installation guide for production hardening, TLS, and scaling advice.

### Docker Deployment

Chronos ships a reference Docker Compose stack under `deploy/docker`:

```bash
make up ARGS="--build -d"   # Build and launch API, workers, scheduler, Mongo, Redis, RabbitMQ, Grafana, Loki
make stop                   # Stop running containers
```

- API – `http://localhost:${GE_PORT:-8000}`
- RabbitMQ Management – `http://localhost:15672` (`chronos/chronos`)
- Grafana – `http://localhost:3000` (`admin/admin`)

For container image documentation, see [`deploy/docker/README.md`](deploy/docker/README.md). Publishing to Docker Hub / Quay.io is automated via `.github/fiware/image-clone.sh`.

## Usage Walkthrough

1. **Register a model** – `POST /models` with FIWARE metadata (entity ID/type, observed attribute) and training hyperparameters.
2. **Launch training** – `POST /models/{id}/training-jobs`, which collects history from STH-Comet, trains TensorFlow models, stores artifacts in GridFS, and persists metrics.
3. **Request forecasts** – `POST /models/{id}/training-jobs/{job}/predict` for on-demand predictions or enable recurring forecasts via `prediction-toggle`.
4. **Publish to Orion** – predictions are upserted as NGSI attributes with optional subscription creation so STH-Comet can ingest generated series.

API examples (with `curl`) are provided in the [API Walkthrough](https://fiware-chronos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/api-walkthrough/).

## Testing & Quality

- **Linting & typing:** `make lint` (flake8 + mypy) must pass before merging.
- **Formatting:** `make format` (black + isort).
- **Unit & integration tests:** `make test` runs pytest with coverage (threshold ≥ 90%).
- **Functional FIWARE tests:** see [`tests/functional/test_orion_integration.py`](tests/functional/test_orion_integration.py) for NGSI interactions.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions workflow [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) executes lint, type check, unit/integration tests, and documentation build per pull request.

Badges above reflect the current status of these quality gates.

- Sign the appropriate [Individual CLA](CLA/individual.md) or [Entity CLA](CLA/entity.md) before submitting pull requests.
- External contributors are encouraged to open issues describing proposed changes prior to implementation.

Pull requests trigger the full CI pipeline, including functional integration tests against mocked FIWARE services.

## Releases

- Semantic versioning (e.g., `1.2.0`) is enforced via Git tags.
- Each release is accompanied by notes in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tcc-chronos/fiware-chronos/releases) section.
- FIWARE catalogue releases are mirrored using `FIWARE_<major>.<minor>` tags and multi-arch Docker images (`latest`, `<semver>`, `FIWARE_<major>.<minor>`).
- Release automation notifies the FIWARE infrastructure via `.github/fiware/image-clone.sh`.
