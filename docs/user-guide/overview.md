# User Guide Overview

Chronos simplifies forecasting within FIWARE-based ecosystems. This guide introduces the core concepts and provides the minimum steps to ingest data, train models, and publish predictions.

## Prerequisites

- Running FIWARE stack including Orion Context Broker, IoT Agent, and STH-Comet.
- Chronos deployed locally or via Docker Compose (`deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml`).
- API credentials to access your FIWARE services (tenant/service path).

## Core Concepts

- **Model** – configuration describing the neural architecture (LSTM/GRU), FIWARE entity metadata, and training hyperparameters.
- **Training Job** – asynchronous process that fetches history from STH-Comet, trains TensorFlow models, and stores artefacts in MongoDB/GridFS.
- **Prediction** – forecast results published as NGSI attributes in Orion and optionally subscribed to STH-Comet.

## Quickstart

1. **Create a model**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/models \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "name": "smart-building-humidity",
       "entity_id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Sensor:001",
       "entity_type": "Sensor",
       "feature": "humidity",
       "model_type": "LSTM",
       "lookback_window": 48,
       "forecast_horizon": 6
     }'
   ```
2. **Trigger training**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/models/{model_id}/training-jobs
   ```
3. **Check status**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/models/{model_id}/training-jobs/{job_id}
   ```
4. **Publish forecasts**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/models/{model_id}/training-jobs/{job_id}/prediction-toggle \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"enabled": true}'
   ```

Chronos creates the target entity in Orion when absent and updates the attribute `forecastSeries` by default. Adjust attribute names through the API payload.
